I'm <strong>Paula Morales Rodríguez</strong>, cats, with their elegance, independence and mystery, have always fascinated me. More than pets, they are for me life companions, masters of wisdom and guardians of ancestral secrets.</p><p class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'>That deep connection with the feline world prompted me to become a <strong>Veterinarian</strong>, a decision that not only fills me with professional satisfaction, but also allows me to merge my passion for art with my vocation of service.</p><blockquote class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'><q>Since I was a child, my heart has beaten to the rhythm of a purr</q>.</blockquote><p class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'>Beyond the white coats and medical instruments, I am a feline medical artist. I use my creativity and sensitivity to understand each cat as a unique individual, giving them the personalized attention they need to flourish.</p><p class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'>When I am not taking care of my feline patients, I take refuge in the world of colors and shapes. Painting is my escape, my way of expressing the emotions that flood me when interacting with these wonderful beings. I also enjoy the company of my family and friends, those fundamental pillars that fill me with energy and remind me of the importance of emotional ties.</p><p class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'>And when the adventurous spirit calls me, I embark on trips that allow me to discover new cultures, landscapes and flavors.

I am always committed to the welfare of cats and I am passionate about giving them the attention they deserve.</p><p class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'>The organism and functioning of cats is somewhat complex, so I always seek to train myself to treat any eventuality. In addition to my practical experience, I have done complementary studies, such as the <i>Curso Internacional Medicina Felina al Extremo</i>, which has allowed me to deepen in the specific feeding and behavior of cats for the impact on their welfare.</p><p class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 text-neutral-700'>I have also attended many veterinary conferences at national congresses on topics such as feline ethology, preventive medicine, and the latest trends in treatment.
